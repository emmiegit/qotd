.SH NAME
qotdd \- A daemon to provide an interesting quote every day.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
qotdd [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.P
qotdd [\fB\-\-help\fP | \fB\-\-version\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
QOTD (quote of the day) is specified in RFC 865 as a way of broadcasting a quote to users. On both TCP and UDP, port 17 is officially reserved for this purpose. \fBqotdd\fP(8) is meant to provide a simple QOTD daemon on IPv4 and/or IPv6 on either TCP or UDP.
.P
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-foreground\fP
Do not fork, but run in the foreground.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-config\fP \fIconfig\-file\fP
Specify an alternate configuration file location. The default is at `\fI/etc/qotd.conf\fP'. You can save two characters and use the alias \fB\-\-conf\fP instead. (Overrides a previous \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-N\fP option)
.TP
\fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-noconfig\fP
Do not read from a configuration file, but use the default options instead. You can save two characters and use the alias \fB\-\-noconf\fP instead. (Overrides a previous \fB\-c\fP option)
.TP
\fB\-\-lax\fP
Disable strict configuration parsing. Without this option, the daemon will perform security checks on input files. Be aware that using this option makes the program vulnerable to confused deputy attacks.
.TP
For more information on the following three options, see \fBqotd.conf\fP(5):
.TP
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-\-pidfile\fP \fIpidfile\fP
Override the pidfile name given in the configuration file with the given file instead.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-quotes\fP \fIquotes\-file\fP
Override the quotes file given in the configuration file with the given file instead.
.TP
\fB\-j\fP, \fB\-\-journal\fP \fIjournal\-file\fP
Overrides the journal file given in the configuration file with the given file instead.
.TP
\fB\-4\fP, \fB\-\-ipv4\fP
Only listen on IPv4. The default behavior is to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6.
.TP
\fB\-6\fP, \fB\-\-ipv6\fP
Only listen on IPv6.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-tcp\fP
Use TCP instead of UDP. This is the default behavior.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-\-udp\fP
Use UDP instead of TCP. (Not fully implemented yet)
.TP
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
Only output error messages. This is the same as using `\fB\-\-journal\fP \fI/dev/null\fP'.
.TP
.BR \-\-help
List all options and what they do.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Print the version and some basic license information.
